This is the "CS682-Software Development Lab" capstone course at UMass Boston, where our computer science team collaborates with the engineering team to build the "Artifical Intelligence Animal Gateway" project.

(As part of computer science)In this project we used ,
-> Raspberry Pi 4 of  Debian 11.0 operating system.
-> Python Virtual Environment.
-> Pre-trained model (MobileNet) which is trained on imageNet dataset to detect cat.
-> Flask server.
-> Picamera.

1) We installed Debian 11.0 operating system by SD card flash.
2) We created python virtual environment using command [python3 -m venv /path/to/store/virtual_environement_files] in termnial.
3) Activated python virtual environment using command [source /path/to/store/virtual_environement_files/bin/activate]
4) complie python file using command [python3 DetectCat.py]
5) Open browser type [ip_address:port_number/method_name]
6) Capture image 
7) Prints predicted result.
